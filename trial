Team Building
①To have weekly meeting of knowledge sharing between team members through which everyone can learn new things and the knowledge can be used in next projects.
-> As everyone is working on different projects/subsytems, if we share knowledge mong us then we can increase our knowledge scope.
②Note the processes and make manual which can be shared to new members, which will make their work easy and also help if somebody get stucked in between.
-> If new membes enters in team, manuals will help to learn work-flow.
③Make the bonding between members strong so that work environment will be positive and hence will reduce the working cost. Example-Birthday Celebrations,Get-together Events etc.
-> If we increase the bonding between team members then it will show positive impact on work collaboration.
